# Study-on-Variation-of-Number-of-Asthmatic-Patients-Admitted-using-Control-Charts-


Tools Used: JMP, Python, Excel

Initial Analysis of the mean shift in the Patients getting admitted between 2010 – 2018 was done by the application of C – chart. Since, the Change is very minimal (1σ), CUSUM Chart was also employed for detecting the mean shift. 
  
Assignable and Chance cause were studied to understand the Mean shift, and the variation of the causes (Amount of Ozone, SO2 and CO) were also studied for this very same period using X/MR Chart and CUSUM Chart.
